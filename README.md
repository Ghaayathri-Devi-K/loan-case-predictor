## Description
A classifier is built to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. 
The data is modelled using 
<ol>
<li>KNN</li>
<li> Decision trees</li>
<li>SVM</li>
<li>Logistic Regression</li>
</ol>
Then the model is trained using a dataset depicting loan cases. The accuracy of the models is calculated and compared among one another. 
The performance of the model is tested using 
<ol>
<li>Jaccard index</li>
<li>f1-score</li>
<li>log loss</li>
</ol>
